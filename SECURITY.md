## Reporting a Vulnerability

- I take security bugs very seriously and I am sincerely appreciative of their responsible disclosure.

- **DO NOT** open a Github issue disclosing the vulnerability. Instead, use Github's Security Advisory tab.
- I will keep you posted with the status of the fix, and may call on your assistance in testing.
