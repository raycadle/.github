## How To Contribute

### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open a issue if the bug is a security vulnerability.** Instead, refer to our security policy.
* **Ensure the bug was not already reported.** Search under the Issues tab.
* **If there are no open issues addressing the problem, open a new one.** Be sure to include a title, a clear description, and as much relevant information as possible. If possible, use a relevant bug report template to create the issue.

### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* **Open a new pull request with the patch.** Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* **Give a heads-up before you start writing code.** Some features or changes may not be in the project's roadmap and would be a waste of time to do.
* **Do not open an issue on GitHub for feature discussion.** GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

### **Do you have questions?**

* Ask any questions in the discussions or on my socials.

Thanks! :heart:
