## How To Contribute

### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability.** Instead, refer to our security policy.
* **Ensure the bug was not already reported.** Search on GitHub under the Issues tab.
* If there are no open issues addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title, a clear description, and as much relevant information as possible. If possible, use a relevant bug report template to create the issue.

### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [rubyonrails-core mailing list](https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/c/rubyonrails-core) and start writing code.
* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Ruby on Rails in the [rubyonrails-talk mailing list](https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/c/rubyonrails-talk).
