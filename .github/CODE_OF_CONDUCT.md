# Code of Conduct

## General Guidelines
1. Everyone is human, don't be an ass. Treat others as you would treat youselfâ€”or better.
2. Keep it on topic. If the conversation is not about the project, then let's take it somewhere else.
3. Help out with issues and PRs. We can go far alone, but we can go farther together.
4. Teach others and keep learning. Noone know's everything, and anyone can teach you something new.
